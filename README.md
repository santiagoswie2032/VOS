okay so when we turn on your pc, the cpu wakes up briefly and it loads up the first 512 bytes which is the bootloader. Bootloader then loads the kernel
the kernel wakes up the cpu properly, manages memory, wakes up OS, kernel is basically the bridge or the translator between cpu and other hardware components to OS.
